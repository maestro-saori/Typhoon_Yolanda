<h3>First of all, let's learn on how typhoons develop overtime and how landforms and bodies of water affect typhoons.</h3>
<img src="typhoon development.png" alt="" width="90%" height="auto" class="typhoon-development">
<p>Typhoons are born from intense wind strengths that attract clouds in one place that’s ready to pour a heavy rainfall. Over time it will travel on land and gather as much wind and clouds which causes it to form heavy thunderstorms, flooding, tornadoes and in close islands can cause strong waves in the ocean.</p>

<p>How do the landforms and bodies of water affect the typhoon?
  Typhoons are known as humid storms, they destroy cultivation and humans’ lives. One of the most important factors are the landforms over which they travel including the bodies of water.
  
  <p>Here are the landforms that can affect typhoons:</p>
  
  
  <p>Mountains: Mountains act as huge barriers, forcing typhoons to change direction or even lose strength.</p>
  
  <p>Coastal areas: Coastal areas are open to storm surges and floods, which can be weakened by typhoons.</p>
  
  <p>Valleys: Valleys can cooperate as passages for typhoons, regulating their path and boosting their danger as soon as they pass.</p>
  
  <p>Plateaus: Plateaus can affect the formation of typhoons by changing the conditions in the areas.</p>
  
  <p>Another important factor is that bodies of water can as well affect typhoons.</p>


<h3>Bodies of water affecting typhoons</h3>
  <p>The power of the typhoons can be affected by the bodies of water. Warm water can be the lead of the dangers of the typhoon, with higher temperatures developing in more serious storms. This means that when a typhoon passes over a warm body of water, the wind speed can accumulate in a powerful way. On the other hand, cooler water gives storms less energy, causing it to diminish. Additionally, as a typhoon crosses a particular land, it loses its energy and quickly decreases in strength.</p>

  <h3>Typhoon Yolanda</h3>

<p>Typhoon Haiyan (locally known as Yolanda) was among the largest and most destructive typhoons in history. Typhoon Yolanda stands among the most powerful storms in history, with strong winds of 270 kilometers per hour during landfall. It was a Category 5 cyclone; for comparison, Hurricane Katrina was a Category 3 at landfall. In terms of casualties, it is among one of the deadliest typhoons that have hit the Philippines. Typhoon Yolanda has left more than 5,600 dead, 1,700 missing, and 26,000 injured in the central Philippines. During Yolanda’s invasion, the biggest amount of rainfall was 223 mm in Calapan City, Oriental Mindoro, 154.2 mm in Surigao City, and 125.7 mm in Puerto Princesa City, Ordinario told the Inquirer in a phone interview. It made landfall on the morning of 8 November 2013 in Guiuan, Eastern Samar province.</p>

<p>Typhoon Yolanda caused the most visible destruction in Tacloban city, the capital of Leyte province. The storm affected most of Eastern Visayas or Region VIII, the nation's 3rd poorest region, with a poverty prevalance of 45.5 percent of the population, as of the 1st semester of 2012. The total damage and loss was estimated at PHP 571.1 billion (USD 12.9 billion) inhibiting economic growth by about 0.9 % in 2013, and another 0.3 % in 2014.2 Considering that Typhoon Yolanda was declared a level 3 category by the United Nations, it brought about several issues on the disaster governance aspect. Many cities and towns experienced widespread destruction, with as much as 90 per cent of housing destroyed in some areas. It is estimated that over 16 million people were affected; 4 million displaced; and more than 6,000 deaths in 41 provinces across 9 regions.</p>

<h3>How did the typhoon affect the community?</h3>
<p>When Typhoon Haiyan tore across the central Philippines in November 2013, it affected millions of people, and left many displaced from their homes. The destructive forces of the storm devastated large parts of the country’s low-lying coastal farming and fishing communities, destroying the livelihoods of some of the nation’s poorest people.</p>

<p>Community organizing in the Haiyan recovery and reconstruction program has played a significant role in the realization of people’s new hopes and dreams as they emerged from the nightmarish post-disaster life.</p>
<hr>
  <h3>Vulnerability to Typhoons</h3>
<p>Every year, an average of 20 typhoons enter the Philippines, with the most intense occurring between July and October; each one has the potential to cause devastating floods and landslides.

  The Philippines’ fragility and high risk are also attributed to its placement in the Pacific Ocean’s ring of fire and typhoon belt, which is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
  
  Poverty and underdevelopment also leave the country vulnerable to calamities.
  
  According to an Asian Development Bank research, Filipinos living in poverty, including those who rely on agriculture, are the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change and extreme events.
  
  The WEF’s Global Risks Report 2023 found that natural disasters and extreme weather occurrences are the country’s top risk over the next two years. This is followed by a debt crisis, rapid and prolonged inflation, misinformation, and geopolitical competition for resources.
  
  Natural disasters such as typhoons, which frequently strike the Philippines, could easily reverse the country’s economic recovery.

  <p>As of November 11, Typhoon Yolanda/Haiyan had caused at least 1,774 deaths, affected an estimated 9.7 million people, and damaged or destroyed approximately 23,200 houses, as well as public infrastructure and agricultural land, across 41 provinces, according to the NDRRMC.</p>

  <h3>What were the secondary effects?</h3>

<p>Social effects</p>
<ul>
  <li>Infection and diseases spread, mainly due to contaminated surface and groundwater.</li>
  <li>Survivors fought for food and supplies. Eight people died in a stampede for food supplies.</li>
  <li>Power supplies were cut off for months in some areas.</li>
  <li>Education was disrupted as many schools were destroyed.</li>
  <li>Seawater, chemicals, and sewerage contaminated surface and groundwater.</li>
</ul>

<p>Economic effects</p>
<ul>
  <li>An oil tanker ran aground, causing an 800,000-liter oil leak that contaminated fishing waters.</li>
  <li>The airport was badly damaged, and roads were blocked by debris and trees.</li>
  <li>Looting was rife due to the lack of food and supplies.</li>
  <li>Rice prices had risen by nearly 12% by 2014.</li>
</ul>

<p>Environmental effects</p>
<ul>
  <li>The leak from the oil barge led to ten hectares of mangroves being contaminated.</li>
  <li>Flooding caused landslides.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many cities and towns experienced widespread destruction, with as much as 90 per cent of housing destroyed in some areas. It is estimated that over 16 million people were affected; 4 million displaced; and more than 6,000 deaths in 41 provinces across 9 regions.</p>

<p>Two weeks after Typhoon Yolanda slammed into The Philippines, relief efforts have finally begun to reach the 10 million affected people. In the region that was hardest hit, much of the productive infrastructure has been wiped out. On a positive note, impacts to the wider macroeconomy are expected to be limited. But this masks the longer-term influence of frequent natural disasters on economic outcomes in the Philippines.</p>
